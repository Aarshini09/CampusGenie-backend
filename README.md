> **"Turning WhatsApp Chaos into Calendar Clarity."**

**CampusGenie** is a smart student productivity tool designed to solve the problem of missed deadlines hidden in hundreds of WhatsApp messages. It uses GenAI to parse informal text and Droidrun automation to sync events directly to the Android Calendar.

---

## 🏗️ How It Works (The Flow)
1.  **Input:** User pastes a messy WhatsApp message (e.g., *"Kal maths ka assignment submit karna hai aur 18 ko quiz hai"*).
2.  **Processing:** The backend sends this text to our **Fine-Tuned LLM** (Gemini) with custom prompt engineering.
3.  **Extraction:** The AI converts the text into structured JSON data (Title, Date, Time, Priority).
4.  **Action:** The app uses **Droidrun SDK** to instantly open the native Calendar app with all details pre-filled.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Smart Message Analysis
Unlike basic regex, our AI understands **Hinglish** and context. It extracts:
* **Summaries:** Short, actionable tasks.
* **Deadlines:** Converts "tomorrow" or "next Friday" into actual dates.
* *Powered by custom Prompt Engineering.*

### 2. 📅 One-Tap Droidrun Sync
We integrated the **Droidrun SDK** to bridge the gap between web and native Android.
* No manual typing required.
* Click "Add to Calendar" -> Event Saved.

### 3. 📚 Topic Simplifier
Stuck on a complex topic? Just type it in.
* Get explanations in simple student-friendly language.
* Includes real-world examples.
